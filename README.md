### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer living in San Francisco!

I currently work at [Brex](https://www.brex.com/) as a Software Engineer building Financial Infrastructure. I used to work on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) Storage Lifecycle at Google.

Sometimes I pick up side projects or contribute to open source but right now I'm looking for something new to work on ðŸ¤·
